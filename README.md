# Alarm-Clock-Omega2-Onion
In university course ECE 150(Fundamentals of programming) , I have built a multi-functional alarm clock using C++ programming language which count as an omega onion 2 project. 
## Introduction 
Functions of this alarm clock are: displaying current time, setting an alarm time, counting down as a timer and generating sound to awake people. Main components of this device are one LED, one OLED screen, one buzzer and one button.

* The main parts of codes are class changeTimeFormat, class countDown, function playMusic(), function getTime() and a piece of codes receive signals from the button.
